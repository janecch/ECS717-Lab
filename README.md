<p>Needs the Arduino IDE</p>
<p>- The Elisa3 Library can be downloaded from the wiki<br />
   - The wiki also explains how to add the Library to the IDE<br />
   - The program can be uploaded to the robots using the IDE.</p>
<p>The program only allows the robots to respond to commands coming from the base station.<br /></p>

<h3 id="library">pc-side-elisa3-library</h3>
<p>OS Windows 10</p>
<p>The radio module drivers should be installed on the PC. The Link can be found on GCtronic-wiki
http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/Elisa-3/</p>

<p>Once the project has been imported in the IDE you should be able to run it.<br />
   Input number of robots available and their addresses.</p>
